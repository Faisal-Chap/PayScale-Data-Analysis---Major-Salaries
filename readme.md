# 🎓📊 PayScale Data Analysis of University Majors

Welcome to this data exploration project where we analyze the **Post-University Salary Data** of various college majors to uncover insights about earnings potential. This analysis uses real survey data provided by PayScale and explores trends in salaries based on different academic disciplines.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

We aim to answer the following key questions:

1. 💸 **Which majors get the highest pay right after graduation?**
2. 🧾 **Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?**
3. 🚀 **Which degrees have the highest earning potential (top 10% earners)?**
4. ⚖️ **What are the lowest risk majors in terms of salary variation?**
5. 🧠 **Which category earns more on average — Business, STEM, or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences)?**

- `Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary`
- `Group` (STEM, Business, HASS)

> Make sure the dataset is placed in the same directory or uploaded to Google Colab for analysis.
